Sinatra app for Todo webapp

## Installation

You need to have ruby 3.1.2 installed. You also need to have postgres installed.

### Download the code

run

```
git clone git@github.com:SarahNWest/todo_v2_app.git
```

from your terminal.

### Create the database `todos`

```
createdb todos
```

### upload the schema

```
psql -d todos < schema.sql
```

## Starting the application

bundle exec ruby todo.rb

**Note**
Using bundle exec to execute the file ensures that the file is executed using the correct gem versions. You can have multiple versions of a gem installed in your operating system and Bundler is used to isolate the applications gem dependancies from other gems installed on your system.

## Using a Postgres database

This application moves from using session persistence through cookies to using a psql database for data persistence.

This involves dynamically creating SQL statements.

### Usefule PG commands

| Command |	What it does |
| -------- | -------- |
| PG.connect(dbname: "a_database") |	Create a new PG::Connection object |
| connection.exec("SELECT * FROM table_name")	| execute a SQL query and return a PG::Result object |
| result.values |	Returns an Array of Arrays containing values for each row in result |
| result.fields |	Returns the names of columns as an Array of Strings |
| result.ntuples | Returns the number of rows in result |
| result.each(&block) |	Yields a Hash of column names and values to the block for each row in result |
| result.each_row(&block) |	Yields an Array of values to the block for each row in result |
| result[index] |	Returns a Hash of values for row at index in result |
| result.field_values(column) |	Returns an Array of values for column, one for each row in result |
| result.column_values(index) |	Returns an Array of values for column at index, one for each row in result |

### Adding a schema to the database

from command line
```
psql -d todos < schema.sql
```

from postgres interface (replace the file path with the location of the schema file)
```
\i ~/Documents/Coding/todo_v2_app/schema.sql
```

### Database design

There are two tables with a one to many relationship. Todos references the primary key of the lists table. To keep referential integrity we included the constraints `NOT NULL` and `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

The names for lists and todos use the type `text` because the length of the names is unknown.

### Preventing SQL injection

instead of using  `PG::Connection#exec` to execute SQL statements this project uses `PG::Connection#exec_params`.

See the `query` method in the `DatabasePersistence` class.

### N + 1 Queries

Made database interactions more efficient by making SQL queries more specialized.
